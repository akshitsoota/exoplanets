Exoplanets
=========

An interactive version of [XKCD 1071: Exoplanets](http://xkcd.com/1071/) using mass data from [The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia](http://exoplanet.eu/catalog-RV.php) and adapted code from [the d3.js Bubble Chart example](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/bubble.html) by [@mbostock](http://twitter.com/mbostock).
                    
Planets are drawn to scale. All blue planets are smaller than Jupiter. Light brown is 1-8, dark brown is 8-16, and red is 16-34 times the size of Jupiter.
